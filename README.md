# Hyperswitch Unified Checkout Demo

The Hyperswitch demo app is a two-page website that showcases the capabilities of the Hyperswitch SDK for enabling a seamless e-commerce experience for customers. The website is designed to look like a typical e-commerce website with a homepage and a product page.

When customers click on checkout with Hyperswitch , they are taken to the product page, which displays Hyperswitch SDK and a grid of products. Checkout page is displayed with an image, name, price, and a "Buy Now" button. When a customer clicks on the "Buy Now" button, they are prompted to enter their payment information. The checkout process is handled by the Hyperswitch SDK, which securely collects and processes the customer's information.

#### 1. Seamless checkout:

#### 2. Security:

#### 3. Customizability: 
The SDK can be easily customized to match the branding and style of any e-commerce website.
